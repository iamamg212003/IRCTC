This repository implements an IRCTC-inspired railway reservation system developed in Java, designed to simulate real-world train ticket booking operations. The project focuses on core functionalities such as user registration and authentication, train search, seat availability checking, ticket booking, and reservation management. Built using Java with Gradle for dependency and build management, the application follows a modular and scalable architecture to ensure maintainability and extensibility. This project serves as a practical demonstration of object-oriented programming principles, exception handling, and real-world system design in Java.
